# Terraform with AWS

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure-as-code software tool created by HashiCorp.
With Terraform we can automate Infrastructure to provision and manage resources in any cloud or data center. ## https://www.terraform.io/

For this project, an IAM User was created with Administrator access

On Visual Studio code there was the need to install the AWS Toolkits and Terraform extension, and thereafter login with the already generated Access key ID & Secret access key on the Credentials profile command palette.

Which generated various AWS resource Templates in our selected Region.
